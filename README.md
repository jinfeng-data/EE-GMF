# Electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation method: EE-GMF

This project presents the EE-GMF codes for the fragment-based quantum calculation of the water culster.

The EE-GMF codes for the energy and force calculations (but without hessian) are in the "EE-GMF" directory. 
The EE-GMF codes for the hessian calculations are in the "EE-GMF_hessian" directory. The guide for running 
EE-GMF calculation is summarized in the README file in the corresponding same directory.
