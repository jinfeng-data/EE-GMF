# Electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation method: EE-GMF

This project presents the EE-GMF codes for the fragment-based quantum calculation of the water culster
and condensed-phase water.

The EE-GMF codes for the energy and force calculations (but without hessian) of water clusters are in 
the "EE-GMF" directory. The EE-GMF codes for the hessian calculations of water clusters are in the 
"EE-GMF_hessian" directory. The "PBC-EE-GMF" directory contains the codes for the energy and force 
calculation of the condensed-phase water system. The guide for running EE-GMF calculation is summarized in the README file 
in the corresponding same directory.
