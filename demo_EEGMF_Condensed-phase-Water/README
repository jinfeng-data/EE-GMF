This is a demo to run the PBC-EE-GMF (or EE-GMF) calculations of the condensed phase water system.

1. The perform_calc.f90 program read water structures from the struc.crd file, which contains multiple
water structures with each having 64 water molecules in the periodic boundary condition box. And then it
start the PBC-EE-GMF calculations. The run.sh is the job submitting script in our computation platform.

2. The calculation generates the system energy and atomic forces in the out_withoutEwald.data and force_
withoutEwald.dat files, which can be used to train the deep potential.
