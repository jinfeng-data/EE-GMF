DP-CC Potential for Liquid Water (by Liu Jinfeng 2024.7)

Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------

The DP-CC potential for liquid water is built at the coupled-cluster level of theory
by combining the PBC-EE-GMF fragmentation method and neural network deep learning method.
This potential can be used for accurate and efficient molecular dynamics simulations and 
path integral molecular dynamic simulations of liquid water.
