EE-GMF v0.1 (by Liu Jinfeng 2021.5)

Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------

The electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE-GMF) method 
is developed for quantum calculation of large-sized molecular clusters at diverse 
ab initio levels. In this method, each individual molecule of the cluster could be 
treated as a fragment with the remaining molecules representing as the background. 
The energy of each fragment and the interaction energy between two fragments that 
are spatially in close contact are computed by quantum mechanics, while the two-body
interaction energies between distant fragment pairs are described by classical Coulomb 
interactions. All quantum calculations are embedded in the electrostatic field of the
point charges representing the remaining system to account for the environmental effect.
All quantum calculations are carried out by calling the Gaussian09/16 program.

Compile-------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. It is highly recommended to compile parallel (MPI) version of EE-GMF to accelerate
   the fragment calculation. Hence you should have installed MPI and that mpif90 are 
   in your PATH.
   
1. Open a shell terminal, extract the compressed file to the current directory.

2. cd to the "EE-GMF" folder, and run the following:
   mpif90 frag-main.f90 fragmentation.f90 energy_cal.f90 -o frag.x

Run EE-GMF-----------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Prepare the structure files of the molecular cluster. The pdb file contains the 
   atom name and index, and each individual molecule should be spaced by a "TER". 
   The inpcrd file contains the total number of the atom and the atomic coordinates.
   Put the names of the used computation nodes to the hostfile. 

1. run the "run_frag.sh" script to start EE-GMF.

Use EE-GMF for molecular minimization-------------------------------------------

The EE-GMF program can be interfaced with the geometry-optimization method. We use
the quasi-Newton algorithm, which can be found in the numerical recipes, to optimize 
the molecular structure. For each step of the optimizaiton, the energy and the atomic 
forces can be calculated by EE-GMF. Hence one could call EE-GMF in their optimization 
program to achieve the quantum molecular optimization.
