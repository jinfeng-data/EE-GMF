PBC-EE-GMF v1.1 (by Liu Jinfeng 2024.7)

Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------

The electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE-GMF) method 
under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is developed for quantum calculation of 
periodic condensed-phase liquid water at diverse ab initio levels. In this method, 
each individual water molecule of the system could be treated as a fragment with 
the remaining molecules representing as the background. The energy of each fragment 
and the interactions of two-body and three-body interactions between fragments that 
are spatially in close contact are computed by quantum mechanics, while the long-range
interaction energies between distant fragment pairs are described by classical Coulomb 
interactions. The local many-body interactions between molecules from neighboring
unit cells are also calculated by quantum calculations. All quantum calculations are 
embedded in the electrostatic field of the point charges representing the remaining 
system to account for the environmental effect. All quantum calculations are carried 
out by calling the Gaussian09/16 program.

Compile-------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. It is highly recommended to compile parallel (MPI) version of PBC-EE-GMF to accelerate
   the fragment calculation. Hence you should have installed MPI and that mpif90 are 
   in your PATH.
   
1. Open a shell terminal, extract the compressed file to the current directory.

2. cd to the "PBC-EE-GMF" folder, and run the following:
   mpif90 main.f90 fragmentation.f90 energy_cal.f90 -o frag.x

Run PBC-EE-GMF-----------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Prepare the structure files of the molecular cluster. The pdb file contains the 
   atom name and index, and each individual molecule should be spaced by a "TER". 
   The inpcrd file contains the total number of the atom and the atomic coordinates.
   Put the names of the used computation nodes to the hostfile. 

1. run the "run_frag.sh" script to start PBC-EE-GMF.
