EE-GMF v0.1 (by Liu Jinfeng 2021.5)

Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------

The electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation (EE-GMF) method 
is developed for quantum calculation of large-sized molecular clusters at diverse 
ab initio levels. In this method, each individual molecule of the cluster could be 
treated as a fragment with the remaining molecules representing as the background. 
The energy of each fragment and the interaction energy between two fragments that 
are spatially in close contact are computed by quantum mechanics, while the two-body
interaction energies between distant fragment pairs are described by classical Coulomb 
interactions. All quantum calculations are embedded in the electrostatic field of the
point charges representing the remaining system to account for the environmental effect.
All quantum calculations are carried out by calling the Gaussian09/16 program.

Compile-------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. It is highly recommended to compile parallel (MPI) version of EE-GMF to accelerate
   the fragment calculation. Hence you should have installed MPI and that mpif90 are 
   in your PATH.
   
1. Open a shell terminal, extract the compressed file to the current directory.

2. cd to the "EE-GMF_hessian" folder, and run the following:
   mpif90 frag-main.f90 fragmentation.f90 energy_cal.f90 -o frag.x
   ifort -CB parameter.f90 -o parameter.x

Run EE-GMF-----------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Prepare the optimized structure files of the molecular cluster. The pdb file 
   contains the atom name and index, and each individual molecule should be spaced 
   by a "TER". The rst file contains the total number of the atom and the optimized 
   atomic coordinates. Put the names of the used computation nodes to the hostfile. 

1. If one want to obtain the polarizability derivative information, edit the fragmentation.f90
   file to change 'freq' to 'freq=raman'.

2. run the "run_frag.sh" script to start EE-GMF.

3. ./parameter.x generates the hessian matrix, dipole and polarizability derivatives 
   in the hessian.info, dipole_deriv.info, and raman.txt files respectively.
